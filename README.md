# PIC16F84A projects

Here are different projects I programmed with the microcontroller PIC16F84A.

I use the following software, tools and compiler to program and flash the microcontroller:
- [sdcc v4.5.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc/files/sdcc-linux-amd64/4.5.0/)
- PICkit 2 to flash the microcontroller
- [pk2cmd v1.27.01](https://github.com/jaka-fi/pk2cmd/releases/tag/v1.27.01)
- Ubuntu 24.04

## Projects

### Led animations:
This project runs different LED animations. The user can change to a different animation when the push button is pressed.

This is an implementation of a timer where the time is diplayed in seven-segment displays.
